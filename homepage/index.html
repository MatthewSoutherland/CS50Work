                    <h3>About myself</h3>
                    <h4 id="professionally">Professionally</h4>
                    <p>I graduated from the University of Northwester Ohio in 2006, with a double diploma in automotive technology and heavy truck repair.
                        I worked for Firestone as a machanic then I got a better job working for Waste Management. After a few years of my body taking a beating,
                        I realized that I needed to learn a new skill. The older guys were wearing back braces on vicodin and could hardly move.
                        I then got a job with Merrill Technologies, the company im currently at after 15 years. Merrill is a diversified manufactering
                        company that produces world class, state of the art technolgy. With a lot of hard work I have become a senior machinist/programmer.
                        No one would believe my responsabilities if I shared them, so I wont. I will say that Merrill is an amazing company with some of the best
                        talent on the planet.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="personally">Personally</h4>
                    <p>It all started in Pontiac Michigan, raised by a single teenage mother on welfare. If your not familiar with Pontiac, just imagine the
                        worst areas in Detroit. My mother with the help of my grandparents did the best thing you could do for a child. They taught me hard
                        work, respect, honor and loyalty. Its because of these values instilled in me that I have been able to be successful in this world.
                        At 38 years old I am married with two boys. My oldest son Garrett is 13 years old and in NJHS. Lucas my other son, is 8 years
                        old and kicking butt in jujitsu and boxing. I love my family and want to provide for them so they have a better opportunity
                        than I had. Currently im working 55 hours a week for Merrill and addtional 30 to 40 hours a week programming. I still do my best to
                        see the kids sports, but am really looking forward to the future. Im looking forward to becoming a full time software engineer and having more time
                        with family.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="programming">Programming</h4>
                    <p>My journey so far has been short but productive. I started with Python although before I gained valuable skills I heard of
                        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freecodecamp.org</a>. I have been certified in responsive web design and javascript algorithms and data structors.
                        Im currently working on Harvard CS50 and also learning react on Scrimba. I cant think Harvard enough for this course. The overview
                        of frontend and backend has really filled in missing pieces and developed critical skills for me. I am within weeks of completing
                        this course and also front end libraries from code camp. Here is a short list of future targets. Data Visualization with D3, Mastering
                        Github, Node JS, python data science, python machine learning, possibly followed by Harvard artifical intellegence, and a database certificate.
